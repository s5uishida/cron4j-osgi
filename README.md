# cron4j-osgi
This repository contains the MANIFEST.MF file of **the Eclipse plug-in project** for building OSGi bundle of version 2.2.5 of [cron4j](https://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/cron4j/) and the built bundle file. You need Java 8 or higher.

I would like to thank the authors of this very useful cron4j code, and all the contributors.
